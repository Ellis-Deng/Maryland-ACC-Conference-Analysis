# Maryland-ACC-Conference-Analysis

**Description:** In this project, I am taking a dataset that contains 24,029 records of Colleges/Universities and their basketball team performance. This is a small project built off of the College Basketball Analysis. The purpose of the project is to analyze the performance of Maryland in the ACC conference. The data contains the name of the school, the conference, the wins and losses, the season, the coaches, the year, and much more. The project contains the following steps: setting a path for the dataset, narrowing down the data, plotting a scatterplot, plotting a linear regression line, and analyzing the data. 

**Skills:** data analysis, python coding, data visualization, debugging.

**Programming Languages/Tools:** Python, Pandas, google colab/jupyter notebook, matplotlib.
 
**Result:** Created a plot to visualize the data, which allowed for a proper analysis of Maryland's performance in the ACC. Concluded that Maryland did improve during their time in the ACC.
